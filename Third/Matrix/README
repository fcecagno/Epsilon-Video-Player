|  Library matrix -- Ver. G-1.0 1998/12/14   |
+--------------------------------------------+

1. What is this?

  The library "matrix" is for vector/matrix/tensor computation. It
  contains definitions of the classes "vector," "matrix," and
  "tensor3333."

2. Compilation

  Run the "make" command in this directory. If things go well, you will
  find a library file "libmatrix.a" in this directory.  The compiler
  is assumed to be GNU g++.

3. Interdependence

  The following is the interdependence graph.  X->Y means that routines in
  the file X requires routines in the file Y.
