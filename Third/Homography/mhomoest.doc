NAME
	mhomoest - computes a homography from image point 
                   correspondences.

SYNOPSIS
	mhomoest < in-file > out-file

DESCRIPTION
        A homography is computed from two sets of corresponding points.
        "mhomoest" reads input data from the standard input. The
        format of the input data (in-file) is as follows:

	-----------------------------------------------------------
	sz
	x[1]    y[1]
        x[1]'   y[1]'
        ...
        x[sz]   y[sz]
        x[sz]'  y[sz]'
        -----------------------------------------------------------

	sz          : number of corresponding point pairs
	x[i]  y[i]  : image coordinates of the i-th point in the
                      first frame.
	x[i]' y[i]' : image coordinates of the i-th point in the
                      second frame.

        The output of "mhomoest" appears in the standard output. The 
        titles in the output (out-file) indicate:

	H      : computed homography.
	H+, H- : standard deviation pair.

        These are 3 by 3 matrices normalized to norm 1.  The homography
        H is a matrix such that
  
         /    \                  /    \
        | x[i]'|                | x[i] |
        | y[i]'| = constant× H | y[i] |,    i = 1, ..., sz.
        |  1   |                |  1   |
         \    /                  \    /

        The standard deviation pair {H+, H-} describes the reliability
        of the estimate.  For example, if H+ and H- coincide up to,
        say, three significant digits, the estimate H is guaranteed to
        have accuracy up to approximately three significant digits.
        This is a theoretical accuracy bound, and it is impossible to
        improve the accuracy any further for the given data.
