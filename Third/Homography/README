+---------------------------------------+

1. Files

  homoest.c        function "homoest" for homography matrix computation.
  homoest.h        header file for the function "homoest."
  mhomoest.c       main program for the function "homoest."
  mhomoest.doc     document file for the main program.
  in-file          input file for test data.
  out-file         output file for "in-file."


2. Compilation

  Make sure that the library file "libmatrix.a" exists in the
  directory "../Matrix".  If not, download the library file first.
  Next, run the "make" command in this directory. If things go well,
  you will see a command file "mhomoest" in this directory. The
  compiler is assumed to be GNU g++.


3. Test

  Run "mhomoest < in-file > your-out-file" and compare "your-out-file"
  with "out-file." If they are identical, the program is working
  properly.


4. Information for the programs

  For the information about "mhomoest," refer to "mhomoest.doc."  If you
  want to incorporate the function "homoest" into your own programs,
  see the codes in "mhomoest.c" as a reference.
